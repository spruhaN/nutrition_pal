Proposal: 
Nutrient Pal is a way to track macros and calories. Given certain details of the user and their goals, Nutrient Pal should be able to suggest missing macos and reminders so that the user gets closer to the their goals. Nutrient Pal can even suggest certain kinds of meals based on the user's daily intake. Input your daily calorie goal, modified by what activity you do.
